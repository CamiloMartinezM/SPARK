# Tracker Adaptation

This is the official implementation of the second stage of [SPARK](https://kelianb.github.io/SPARK/). This stage consists in adapting a pre-trained monocular face reconstruction method to track a MultiFLARE avatar in real-time through transfer learning.

Supported face trackers:
- [DECA](https://deca.is.tue.mpg.de/)
- [EMOCA](https://emoca.is.tue.mpg.de/)
- [SMIRK](https://github.com/georgeretsi/smirk)

See the top-level [README](../README.md) for license information, installation and training instructions.
